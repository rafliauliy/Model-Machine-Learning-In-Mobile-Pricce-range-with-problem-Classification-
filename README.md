# Mobile Price Classification using Support Vector Machine (Polynomial Kernel)
Team member: Arif Farhan Bukhori & Muhammad Rafli Auliya
# Overview
This is a final project for the course Accelerated Machine Learning Program from Zenius. In this project, a Support Vector Machine (using Polynomial Kernel) is built to classify Mobile Prices. We found out that the model reached an accuracy of about 95.75%. While the base line logistic regression model had a much lower accuracy of 64.50%.
